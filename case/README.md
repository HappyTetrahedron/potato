# potatocase

These are files you can use to 3D-print a case for potato. It's intended to be
mounted on a wall in portrait orientation. All cameras and buttons are
accessible (even the back cam, which could e.g. be placed on a doorspy). The
potato can be put in both ways (upside down or ~~downside up~~ upside up).

The case has to be printed in 2 parts and then glued together.
